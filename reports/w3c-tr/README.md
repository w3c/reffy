Placeholder to store results of crawling the Web platform with a W3C-centric
perspective, starting from the list in [specs-w3c.json](https://github.com/tidoust/reffy/blob/master/specs-w3c.json)
and fetching latest published versions of documents instead of latest Editor's drafts.

Generated results should not be pushed to the Reffy repository but should
rather be pushed to [reffy-reports](https://github.com/tidoust/reffy-reports).
